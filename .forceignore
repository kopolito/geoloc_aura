# Profiles
# because AccountLocator Tab visibility was set for all Profiles
# When we created the Account Locator tab and assigned its visibility to all the profiles,
# the automatic change-tracking in the scratch org noted that the profiles have changed.#
# Naturally, the next time you pull metadata from the scratch org to sync with your local project,
# the CLI will want to pull down profile metadata.
# Since the profiles are not pertinent to your geolocation app
# and not something to track in your source control repository for this project,
# we need to tell Salesforce CLI to ignore the profile changes.
